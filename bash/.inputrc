# The editing-mode variable controls which default set of key bindings is used.
# By default, Readline starts up in Emacs editing mode, where the keystrokes
# are most similar to Emacs. This variable can be set to either ‘emacs’ or
# ‘vi’.
set editing-mode vi

# If set to ‘on’, Readline performs filename matching and completion in a
# case-insensitive fashion. The default value is ‘off’.
set completion-ignore-case on

# This alters the default behavior of the completion functions. If set to ‘on’,
# words which have more than one possible completion cause the matches to be
# listed immediately instead of ringing the bell. The default value is ‘off’.
set show-all-if-ambiguous on

# This alters the default behavior of the completion functions in a fashion
# similar to show-all-if-ambiguous. If set to ‘on’, words which have more than
# one possible completion without any possible partial completion (the possible
# completions don’t share a common prefix) cause the matches to be listed
# immediately instead of ringing the bell. The default value is ‘off’.
set show-all-if-unmodified on

# If set to ‘on’, Readline displays possible completions using different colors
# to indicate their file type. The color definitions are taken from the value
# of the LS_COLORS environment variable. The default is ‘off’.
set colored-stats on

# If set to ‘on’, menu completion displays the common prefix of the list of
# possible completions (which may be empty) before cycling through the list.
# The default is ‘off’.
set menu-complete-display-prefix on

# Use <tab> and <shift-tab> to move through the list of possible completions
TAB:menu-complete
"\e[Z": menu-complete-backward

# Arrow keys to navigate history
"\e[A": history-search-backward
"\e[B": history-search-forward

# clear screen in vi modes

    set keymap vi-command
